# H-0x Code

Your terminal. Your code. Your agent.

Built by team Hyper-0x from Buckleson.

H-0x Code is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt it to your workflows, not the other way around. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Pi Packages](#pi-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.

H-0x Code ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask `h0x` to build what you want or install a third party package that matches your workflow.

H-0x Code runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps. See [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for a real-world SDK integration.

## Share your OSS coding agent sessions

If you use H-0x Code for open source work, please share your coding agent sessions.

Public OSS session data helps improve models, prompts, tools, and evaluations using real development workflows.

For the full explanation, see [this post on X](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2037811643774652911).

To publish sessions, use [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). Read its README.md for setup instructions. All you need is a Hugging Face account, the Hugging Face CLI, and `pi-share-hf`.

You can also watch [this video](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2041151967695634619), where I show how I publish my `pi-mono` sessions.

I regularly publish my own `pi-mono` work sessions here:

- [badlogicgames/pi-mono on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/badlogicgames/pi-mono)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. H-0x Code does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
h0x
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
h0x
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to H-0x Code. By default, it gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [pi packages](#pi-packages).

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, H-0x Code maintains a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L).

**Subscriptions:**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- GitHub Copilot

**API keys:**
- Anthropic
- Ant Ling
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- NVIDIA NIM
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock
- Mistral
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Cloudflare AI Gateway
- Cloudflare Workers AI
- xAI
- OpenRouter
- Vercel AI Gateway
- ZAI
- ZAI Coding Plan (China)
- OpenCode Zen
- OpenCode Go
- Hugging Face
- Fireworks
- Together AI
- Kimi For Coding
- MiniMax
- Xiaomi MiMo
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (China)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Amsterdam)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Singapore)

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.pi/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

---

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage (`↑` input, `↓` output, `R` cache read, `W` cache write, `CH` latest cache hit rate), cost, context usage, current model

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions (restart required) |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit H-0x Code |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so H-0x Code can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session-format.md](docs/session-format.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
h0x -c                  # Continue most recent session
h0x -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
h0x --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
h0x --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
h0x --session <path|id> # Use specific session file or ID
h0x --fork <path|id>    # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session ID before reusing it with `--session <id>` or `--fork <id>`.

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from a previous user message on the active branch. Opens a selector, copies the active path up to that point, and places the selected prompt in the editor for modification.

**`/clone`** - Duplicate the current active branch into a new session file at the current position. The new session keeps the full active-path history and opens with an empty editor.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.pi/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### H-0x Config

H-0x Code also loads a typed config file with safe defaults:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.h0x/config.json` | Global |
| `.h0x/config.json` | Project (overrides global) |

Schema:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "",
  "providers": {},
  "agentsDir": ".h0x/agents",
  "mcpServers": {},
  "telemetry": false
}
```

Commands:

```bash
h0x config path
h0x config get
h0x config get telemetry
h0x config set telemetry false
h0x config set providers.openai.model gpt-4o
```

Provider configuration is stored in the global H-0x config. Supported providers are `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `openrouter`, and `ollama`.

```bash
h0x provider list
h0x provider add openai --api-key sk-...
h0x provider add ollama --base-url http://localhost:11434
h0x provider test openai
h0x provider remove openai
```

Provider keys are masked in CLI output.

### H-0x Agents

H-0x Code loads custom agents from:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.h0x/agents/` | Global |
| `.h0x/agents/` | Project (overrides global by name) |

Supported formats are `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, and `.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "description": "Senior frontend engineer",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a senior frontend engineer.",
  "tools": ["read", "edit", "terminal"],
  "model": "optional-model-name"
}
```

Commands:

```bash
h0x agent list
h0x agent create --name test-agent --description "Test agent" --prompt "You are a test coding agent."
h0x agent create --from-prompt "You are a senior Flutter engineer who builds clean Flutter apps using Riverpod."
h0x agent show test-agent
h0x agent edit test-agent
h0x run @test-agent "Say hello without editing files"
h0x agent delete test-agent
```

Running `h0x agent create` without flags starts an interactive prompt for name, description, system prompt, tools, and optional model override.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, H-0x Code asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows H-0x Code to load `.pi/settings.json` and `.pi` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, H-0x Code loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`h0x config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `h0x update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.pi/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart H-0x Code for changes to take effect.

### Telemetry and update checks

H-0x Code has two separate startup features:

- **Update check:** fetches `https://pi.dev/api/latest-version` to check whether a newer H-0x Code version exists. Disable it with `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`. Disabling update checks only turns off this check.
- **Install/update telemetry:** after first install or a changelog-detected update, sends an anonymous version ping to `https://pi.dev/api/report-install`. This setting also controls optional provider attribution headers for OpenRouter, Cloudflare, and direct NVIDIA NIM requests. Opt out by setting `enableInstallTelemetry` to `false` in `settings.json`, or by setting `PI_TELEMETRY=0`. This does not disable update checks; H-0x Code may still contact `pi.dev` for the latest version unless update checks are disabled or offline mode is enabled.

Use `--offline` or `PI_OFFLINE=1` to disable all startup network operations described here, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry.

---

## Context Files

H-0x Code loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

Use for project instructions (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.pi/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.pi/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`, `.pi/prompts/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend H-0x Code with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  pi.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  pi.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  pi.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. H-0x Code waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `pi.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make H-0x Code look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, `.pi/extensions/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and H-0x Code immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.pi/agent/themes/`, `.pi/themes/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Pi Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1457744485428629628).

> **Security:** Pi packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
h0x install npm:@foo/pi-tools
h0x install npm:@foo/pi-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
h0x install git:github.com/user/repo
h0x install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
h0x install git:git@github.com:user/repo
h0x install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
h0x install https://github.com/user/repo
h0x install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
h0x install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
h0x install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
h0x remove npm:@foo/pi-tools
h0x uninstall npm:@foo/pi-tools          # alias for remove
h0x list
h0x update                               # update h0x and packages (skips pinned packages)
h0x update --extensions                  # update packages only
h0x update --self                        # update h0x only
h0x update --self --force                # reinstall h0x even if current
h0x update npm:@foo/pi-tools             # update one package
h0x config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.pi/agent/git/` (git) or `~/.pi/agent/npm/` (npm). Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.pi/git/`, `.pi/npm/`). Git `@ref` values are pinned tags or commits; pinned packages are skipped by `h0x update`, so use `h0x install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to move an existing package to a new ref. Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding a `pi` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-pi-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `pi` manifest, pi auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

---

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRegistry = ModelRegistry.create(authStorage);
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage,
  modelRegistry,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
h0x --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

H-0x Code is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [pi packages](#pi-packages). This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape it to fit how you work.

**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support. [Why?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)

**No sub-agents.** There's many ways to do this. Spawn `h0x` instances via tmux, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package that does it your way.

**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.

**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).

**No background bash.** Use tmux. Full observability, direct interaction.

Read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) for the full rationale.

## CLI Reference

```bash
h0x [options] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
h0x install <source> [-l]      # Install package, -l for project-local
h0x remove <source> [-l]       # Remove package
h0x uninstall <source> [-l]    # Alias for remove
h0x update [source|self|h0x]   # Update h0x and packages (skips pinned packages)
h0x update --extensions        # Update packages only
h0x update --self              # Update h0x only
h0x update --self --force      # Reinstall h0x even if current
h0x update --extension <src>   # Update one package
h0x list                       # List installed packages
h0x config                     # Enable/disable package resources
h0x config get [key]           # Show merged H-0x config or one key
h0x config set <key> <value>   # Set a global H-0x config value
h0x config path                # Show H-0x config file paths
h0x provider list              # List configured H-0x providers
h0x provider add <provider>    # Add a provider config
h0x provider remove <provider> # Remove a provider config
h0x provider test <provider>   # Validate a provider config
h0x agent list                 # List configured custom agents
h0x agent create               # Create a global custom agent
h0x agent create --from-prompt # Infer and create a custom agent from one prompt
h0x agent show <name>          # Show a custom agent
h0x agent edit <name>          # Print a custom agent file path
h0x agent delete <name>        # Delete a custom agent
h0x run @<agent> <task>        # Run a task with a custom agent prompt
```

`h0x config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `h0x update` never prompts for project trust.

### Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override config directory (default: `~/.pi/agent`) |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Override session storage directory (overridden by `--session-dir`) |
| `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override package directory (useful for Nix/Guix where store paths tokenize poorly) |
| `PI_OFFLINE` | Disable startup network operations, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry |
| `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Skip the Pi version update check at startup. This prevents the `pi.dev` latest-version request |
| `PI_TELEMETRY` | Override install/update telemetry and provider attribution headers. Use `1`/`true`/`yes` to enable or `0`/`false`/`no` to disable. This does not disable update checks |
| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` for extended prompt cache (Anthropic: 1h, OpenAI: 24h) |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | External editor for Ctrl+G |
